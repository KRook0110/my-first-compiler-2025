# My First Compiler

This is just me learning about the compiler. I wish to make a compiler for a language similar to c.

currently it can only do simple arithmetic, create functions(yes, you can't even call the functions yet), and return. You can see all the working examples int `testtext/`

## How to use :
run `./runscript.sh your_path_to_code`.

## Todo :
- [ ] Create a way to do system calls from code.
- [ ] Seperate main.cpp to multiple files and header files.
